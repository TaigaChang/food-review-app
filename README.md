Create an app that works similarly to yelp with some changes. The first change would be to instead of using a metric like 5 stars, we would use a 100 point systems with different categories like taste, ingredients, ambiance, pricing.

The second change would be that it would find similar ratings to the food you found to show you if that is actually what you would want to rate it.

Finally, instead of a restaurant being able to rest on its laurels, it would have a system where you can find the ratings of the restaurant within 1 year or 1 month, so that you would know if the quality of the food has changed over time.
