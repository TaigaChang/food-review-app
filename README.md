# food-review-app Taiga Chang 10/25/2025

Create an app that works similarly to yelp with some changes. The first change would be to instead of using a metric like 5 stars, we would use a 100 point systems with different categories like taste, ingredients, ambiance, pricing.

The second change would be that it would find similar ratings to the food you found to show you if that is actually what you would want to rate it.

Finally, instead of a restaurant being able to rest on its laurels, it would have a system where you can find the ratings of the restaurant within 1 year or 1 month, so that you would know if the quality of the food has changed over time.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
